i need to call the llmos.sh once

because the only purpose of llmos is to start a docker container

with the configuration that was parsed by justrun.sh

i propose this solution: instead of having a hardcoded Dockerfile

the llmos will use a heredoc:
- to set up the ports correctly
- clone the github repo
- set the correct name

at the end the dockerfile should specify the entrypoint.sh (from the cloned github repo) as the script to run

that script will handle everything that needs to be done inside the container

but our only goal is to start the container with the port configuration

and i think by now you get my point
